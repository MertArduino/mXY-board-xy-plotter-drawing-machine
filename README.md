# Make XY Plotter Drawing Machine with mXY Board
In this project we gonna make XY Plotter Drawing machine with mXY Board. With Drawing Robot you can draw images on wall, panel or A4 paper. You can print pictures or print text. All required hardware for this project are listed below. We will learn how to install and use the Polargraph program for drawing control. </br>

# About mXY Board
My goal was to design the mXY board to make low budget the XY plotter drawing machine. So I designed a board that makes it easier for those who want to make this project. In the previous project, while using 2 pcs Nema17 stepper motors, this board uses 2 pcs the 28BYJ-48 cheaper stepper motors. Also in the previous project, Arduino Uno R3 was used as microcontroller and Adafruit Motor Shield as motor driver. This board uses Atmega328P and ULN2003 stepper driver. So you will be able to make this project with a single board. A 5V 1A adapter or powerbank is sufficient for this project to power consumption. The maximum current was observed as 0.4A when both motors were running.</br>
